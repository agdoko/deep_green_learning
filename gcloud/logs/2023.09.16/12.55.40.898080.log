[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    The [1mgcloud[m CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer
    workflow, and interactions with the Google Cloud APIs.

    For a quick introduction to the [1mgcloud[m CLI, a list of commonly used
    commands, and a look at how these commands are structured, run [1mgcloud
    cheat-sheet[m or see the `gcloud` CLI cheat sheet
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet).

[m[1mGLOBAL FLAGS[m
     [1m--account[m=[4mACCOUNT[m
        Google Cloud user account to use for invocation. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/account[m property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--billing-project[m=[4mBILLING_PROJECT[m
        The Google Cloud project that will be charged quota for operations
        performed in [1mgcloud[m. If you need to operate on one project, but need
        quota against a different project, you can use this flag to specify the
        billing project. If both [1mbilling/quota_project[m and [1m--billing-project[m
        are specified, [1m--billing-project[m takes precedence. Run [1m$ gcloud config
        set --help[m to see more information about [1mbilling/quota_project[m.

     [1m--configuration[m=[4mCONFIGURATION[m
        The configuration to use for this command invocation. For more
        information on how to use configurations, run: [1mgcloud topic
        configurations[m. You can also use the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME
        environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal
        session.

     [1m--flags-file[m=[4mYAML_FILE[m
        A YAML or JSON file that specifies a [1m--flag[m:[1mvalue[m dictionary. Useful
        for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work
        with any command interpreter. Additionally, each [1m--flags-file[m arg is
        replaced by its constituent flags. See $ gcloud topic flags-file for
        more information.

     [1m--flatten[m=[[4mKEY[m,...]
        Flatten [4mname[m[] output resource slices in [4mKEY[m into separate records for
        each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified.
        This also flattens keys for [1m--format[m and [1m--filter[m. For example,
        [1m--flatten=abc.def[m flattens [1mabc.def[].ghi[m references to [1mabc.def.ghi[m. A
        resource record containing [1mabc.def[][m with N elements will expand to N
        records in the flattened output. This allows us to specify what
        [1mresource-key[m the [1mfilter[m will operate on. This flag interacts with other
        flags that are applied in this order: [1m--flatten[m, [1m--sort-by[m, [1m--filter[m,
        [1m--limit[m.

     [1m--format[m=[4mFORMAT[m
        Sets the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
        command-specific human-friendly output format. If both [1mcore/format[m and
        [1m--format[m are specified, [1m--format[m takes precedence. [1m--format[m and
        [1mcore/format[m both take precedence over [1mcore/default_format[m. The
        supported formats are limited to: [1mconfig[m, [1mcsv[m, [1mdefault[m, [1mdiff[m, [1mdisable[m,
        [1mflattened[m, [1mget[m, [1mjson[m, [1mlist[m, [1mmulti[m, [1mnone[m, [1mobject[m, [1mtable[m, [1mtext[m, [1mvalue[m,
        [1myaml[m. For more details run $ gcloud topic formats. Run [1m$ gcloud config
        set --help[m to see more information about [1mcore/format[m

     [1m--help[m
        Display detailed help.

     [1m--project[m=[4mPROJECT_ID[m
        The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
        then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed
        using [1mgcloud config list --format='text(core.project)'[m and can be set
        using [1mgcloud config set project PROJECTID[m.

        [1m--project[m and its fallback [1mcore/project[m property play two roles in the
        invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It
        also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and
        billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing, use
        [1m--billing-project[m or [1mbilling/quota_project[m property.

     [1m--quiet[m, [1m-q[m
        Disable all interactive prompts when running [1mgcloud[m commands. If input
        is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

        Overrides the default core/disable_prompts property value for this
        command invocation. This is equivalent to setting the environment
        variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m to 1.

     [1m--verbosity[m=[4mVERBOSITY[m; default="warning"
        Override the default verbosity for this command. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/verbosity[m property value for this command invocation. [4mVERBOSITY[m
        must be one of: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, [1mnone[m.

     [1m--version[m, [1m-v[m
        Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the
        global level.

     [1m-h[m
        Print a summary help and exit.

[m[1mOTHER FLAGS[m
     [1m--access-token-file[m=[4mACCESS_TOKEN_FILE[m
        A file path to read the access token. Use this flag to authenticate
        [1mgcloud[m with an access token. The credentials of the active account (if
        exists) will be ignored. The file should only contain an access token
        with no other information. Overrides the default [1mauth/access_token_file[m
        property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--impersonate-service-account[m=[4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAILS[m
        For this [1mgcloud[m invocation, all API requests will be made as the given
        service account or target service account in an impersonation
        delegation chain instead of the currently selected account. You can
        specify either a single service account as the impersonator, or a
        comma-separated list of service accounts to create an impersonation
        delegation chain. The impersonation is done without needing to create,
        download, and activate a key for the service account or accounts.

        In order to make API requests as a service account, your currently
        selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
        [1miam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken[m permission for the service account
        or accounts.

        The [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role has the
        [1miam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission[m. You can also create a
        custom role.

        You can specify a list of service accounts, separated with commas. This
        creates an impersonation delegation chain in which each service account
        delegates its permissions to the next service account in the chain.
        Each service account in the list must have the
        [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role on the next service account
        in the list. For example, when [1m--impersonate-service-account=[m
        [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_1[1m[m,[1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_2[1m[m, the active account must have the
        [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role on [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_1[1m[m, which
        must have the [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role on
        [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_2[1m[m. [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_1[1m[m is the impersonated service
        account and [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_2[1m[m is the delegate.

        Overrides the default [1mauth/impersonate_service_account[m property value
        for this command invocation.

     [1m--log-http[m
        Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the
        default [1mcore/log_http[m property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--trace-token[m=[4mTRACE_TOKEN[m
        Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
        issues. Overrides the default [1mcore/trace_token[m property value for this
        command invocation.

     [1m--user-output-enabled[m
        Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/user_output_enabled[m property value for this command invocation.
        Use [1m--no-user-output-enabled[m to disable.
